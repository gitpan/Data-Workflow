Data::Workflow

This module provides a simple worklflow manager that we use to
download data from external sites, reformat and integrate the data,
and load it into internal databases.

A workflow consists of 'steps' that operate on data 'resources'. Steps
may be objects within a defined class hierarchy, standalone programs,
often Perl scripts or shell scripts that wrap built-in sysetm
utilities. Data resources can be local or remote files or directories,
webpages, database tables, or collections of the above. 

You specify a workflow using configuration files that express the
dependencies between steps. These configuration files tell which
resources a given step reads or writes. The workflow manager executes
a step when its input resources are newer than its outputs, or in
other words, when its output is out-of-date.
